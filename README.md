# Iris Data Analysis Project  

## Introduction  
This project explores the **Iris dataset**, one of the most famous datasets in machine learning.  
It was originally introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 and is widely used for classification problems.  

## Dataset Information  
- **150 samples** (50 from each species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).  
- **4 numerical features**:  
  - Sepal Length (cm)  
  - Sepal Width (cm)  
  - Petal Length (cm)  
  - Petal Width (cm)  
- **1 categorical feature**: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).  

##  Objectives  
- Understand relationships between different flower features.  
- Visualize patterns between species.  
- Identify trends or clusters in the dataset.  

##  Files in This Repository  
- `Iris_Analysis.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook for analysis  
- `Iris_Analysis.html` → HTML export of the notebook  
- `Iris_Analysis.md` → Markdown export of the notebook  

##  Key Findings  
**Setosa is easy to classify** because it’s well-separated.  
 **Versicolor & Virginica have overlapping features**, making them harder to distinguish.  
**Petal length and petal width have a strong correlation**.  

##  How to Run This Project  
1. Download the repository.  
2. Open `Iris_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Run all cells to generate insights and visualizations.
